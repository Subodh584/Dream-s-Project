## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security:
- ⚠️ Password is stored in code (for development only)
- 🔐 For production: Use environment variables or secrets manager
- 💡 See `PostgreSQLBestPractices.java` for secure patterns

### Database:
- ✓ All tables already created in schema file
- ✓ Foreign keys and constraints included
- ✓ Indexes for performance added
- ✓ Views created for common queries

### Code Changes:
- ✓ NO changes needed to GUI code
- ✓ NO changes needed to business logic
- ✓ NO changes needed to existing classes
- ⚠️ Be aware: PostgreSQL is case-sensitive (use lowercase)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnosis:
Run `TestPostgresConnection.java` - it will tell you what's wrong

### Common Issues:
| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Driver not found | Add postgresql JAR to lib/ and update NetBeans |
| Connection refused | Verify internet, check Supabase dashboard |
| Table not found | Run SQL schema in Supabase SQL Editor |
| Wrong password | Check credentials in DBConnection.java |
| Permission denied | Verify Supabase credentials are correct |

**See `POSTGRESQL_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting**

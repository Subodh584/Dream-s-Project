## 💡 Pro Tips

✅ **For Windows Users:**
- Double-click `start-docker.bat` is the easiest
- It does everything automatically

✅ **For Mac/Linux Users:**
- Run `chmod +x start-docker.sh` once
- Then `./start-docker.sh` anytime

✅ **For Technical Users:**
- They can run `docker-compose up` directly
- They can modify docker-compose.yml if needed

✅ **For First-Time Docker Users:**
- First run takes 5-10 min (downloading/building)
- Subsequent runs are ~30 seconds
- This is completely normal and expected

✅ **If Someone Needs Help:**
- Tell them to check terminal output first
- Share: DOCKER_SETUP.md Troubleshooting section
- Most issues are solved by restarting Docker
